	About This Website
	I created this website as my first full-stack individual project
		at Skill Distillery. This project was created to practice CRUD --
		Create, Read, Update, Destroy. Enter the website on the home page and
		choose between viewing adoptable dogs or adoptable cats. You can add
		your own animal, and update the notes for each as well. The first
		information you add will be stored in "Current note" and further notes
		are appended. You can remove any animal from the list. In the future, I want to add 
		warning message asking if the users are sure they want to remove the animal.
		Also I would like to put two columns in the filtered pages. 
		
		These are real animals
		who would love to find a forever home. Any action done on this website has
		no link to these organizations themselves.
